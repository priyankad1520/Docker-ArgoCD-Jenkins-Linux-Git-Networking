# ArgoCD 
ArgoCD is a GitOps continuous delivery (CD) tool used in the CD (Continuous Deployment) process.

It automatically deploys and updates applications in Kubernetes based on changes in a Git repository. ArgoCD = “Whatever is in Git → Automatically run in Kubernetes”

- Git is considered the single source of truth. Git repository is the only place where the correct configuration exists. No manual changes allowed in Kubernetes 
- If someone changes cluster manually:  ArgoCD detects drift. Reverts it back to Git state 
- ArgoCD continuously compares: Desired State → what is defined in the Git repository, Actual State → what is currently running in the Kubernetes cluster 
- If there is any difference, ArgoCD automatically syncs and updates the cluster to match the Git repository.
- Drift = difference between desired & actual state and Drift Detection = identifying that difference

#### Key Features of ArgoCD
1. Auto Sync: Automatically deploy changes from Git 
2. Self Healing: If someone manually changes cluster → ArgoCD resets it 
3. Rollback: Easily go back to previous version from Git history 
4. UI Dashboard: Shows app health, status, sync state

A manifest is a YAML or JSON file that describes how an application should run in Kubernetes.

## ArgoCD Architecture:
ArgoCD has API Server for user interaction, Repo Server to fetch Git data/configs, Application Controller to compare and sync states, Redis for caching, and Dex for authentication.

**1. API Server (argocd-server):** Entry point of ArgoCD. It provides Web UI, CLI, and REST API access. 
- Why: To interact with ArgoCD (create apps, view status, trigger sync)
- Without API server, users cannot: View applications, Trigger deployments, Check status
- What it does: Accepts user requests (UI/CLI), Communicates with Application Controller, Shows application status (Synced / OutOfSync) 
- Example: You open ArgoCD UI in browser, You click “Sync” button
- That request goes to API Server → then to Application Controller

**2. Repository Server (argocd-repo-server):** Connects to Git and reads configuration files (YAML, Helm, Kustomize)
- Why: To fetch and convert YAML/Helm/Kustomize into Kubernetes manifests. Kubernetes cannot directly understand Git repo. So repo server: Fetches code Converts it into Kubernetes manifests
- What it does: Pulls latest code from Git. Processes: Helm charts, Kustomize configs, Generates final YAML files
- Example: Reads deployment.yaml from Git and prepares it for deployment
- replicas: 3
- image: nginx:v1  
- Repo server converts this into deployable format. Sends it to Application Controller

**3. Application Controller (argocd-application-controller):** Core component (brain of ArgoCD). Responsible for monitoring and syncing
- Why: To ensure/Compares Desired vs Actual state and performs sync
- What it does: Watches Kubernetes cluster continuously. Gets desired state from repo server 
- Compares: Git config (desired) ==Cluster running state (actual) 
- If mismatch: Syncs automatically (if enabled). Fixes drift
- Example: If Git says 3 pods but cluster has 2 → it creates 1 more pod

**4. Redis:** In-memory data store (cache). 
- Why: To improve performance and reduce repeated Git/API calls
- What it does: Stores temporary data like: Application state. Git data cache. Helps faster response in UI 
- Example: Without Redis: Every time → fetch from Git (slow) 
With Redis: Cached data → faster UI loading. Stores app state temporarily for faster UI response

**5. Dex (Authentication Service):** Identity provider used for authentication (login)
- Why: To manage user login and security. Supports: SSO (Single Sign-On), LDAP, OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- What it does: Verifies user identity. Allows secure login into ArgoCD UI
- Example: You login using Google account. Dex authenticates → gives access to ArgoCD

### Complete Flow (Step-by-Step in Lines)
1.	Developer pushes code to Git 
2.	Repository Server pulls latest configuration 
3.	Repo Server converts config into Kubernetes manifests 
4.	Application Controller gets desired state from repo server 
5.	Application Controller checks actual state in Kubernetes 
6.	If mismatch → sync happens automatically 
7.	API Server shows status in UI (Synced / OutOfSync) 
8.	Redis improves speed by caching data 
9.	Dex handles login and authentication

**Cache:** Cache is a temporary storage area used to store frequently used data so that it can be accessed faster. Example: Browser stores images → next time loads fast and Redis in ArgoCD → stores Git data

**Buffer:** Buffer is temporary storage used to hold data while transferring between systems. Example: Video buffering, Data transfer in network, Keyboard input storage. Buffering does NOT always mean slow internet. It means: The video player is waiting to collect enough data before playing smoothly.

**A queue:** is a data structure or system where data (messages/tasks) are stored and processed in order (FIFO – First In First Out).

Queues are used in CI/CD to manage multiple build and deployment jobs by placing them in a queue and executing them based on available resources. In Kubernetes, queues are used internally by components like the scheduler and controllers to process tasks such as pod scheduling and state reconciliation. Additionally, applications running in Kubernetes use message queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication and workload management.

- Cache → improves speed (reuse data) 
- Buffer → manages data flow (transfer data)
- Queue → Order processing (FIFO)
