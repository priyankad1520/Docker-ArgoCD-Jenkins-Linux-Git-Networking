# Basic Networking Concepts for DevOps Engineers
#### 1. What is Networking?

Networking means connecting computers/devices so they can communicate and share data. / A network is a group of devices connected to communicate with each other.

Example: Internet, Office LAN, Wifi at home, Cloud Networking(AWS VPC)

* Laptop communicates with server
* Browser communicates with website
* Kubernetes pods communicate with each other
* Jenkins communicates with GitHub
---
#### 2. IP Address = Unique address of a device in a network.
Types: 1. IPv4 → `192.168.1.10` and 2. IPv6 → `2001:db8::1`

##### Types of IP

| Type       | Example     | Usage                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Private IP | 192.168.x.x | Internal communication |
| Public IP  | 8.8.8.8     | Internet communication |

#### Important Private IP Ranges

| Range                         | Purpose         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     | Large networks  |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   | Medium networks |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | Home/office     |

#### Commands

```bash
ip addr
ifconfig
hostname -I
```
---
#### 3. ISP: Internet service provider is a company that gives you access to the internet

#### MAC Address = Physical hardware address of NIC card.
```bash
Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  # Used inside local network communication.
```
```bash
Command: ip link
```
---

#### 4. DNS (Domain Name System): DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.
- Example: google.com → 142.250.183.14
- Without DNS: We must remember IP addresses.
- DNS Flow: Browser → DNS Server → IP Address → Website Opens
##### Commands
```bash
nslookup google.com
dig google.com
host google.com
```
---
#### 5. Port Numbers: Ports identify specific application / services running on a system / Device.
```text
Example: IP = House Address
Port = Room Number
```

| Layer          | Purpose            |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 7 Application  | HTTP, DNS. user interaction      |
| 6 Presentation | Encryption. convert data into a secure / encryption formate so hacker can not reat it    |
| 5 Session      | Manages sessions/connections between systems. Responsibilities: Start,Maintain and End sessions  |
| 4 Transport    | TCP: Ensures message reaches correctly. Breaks data into pices/packets, error checking, reliable Delivery, Re-sending if needed /UDP |
| 3 Network      | Finding/ decides the best path/Route. Use IP address and Routers work here         |
| 2 Data Link    | Tranfers data within local Network using MAC Address  Wi-fi ethernet      |
| 1 Physical     | Actual singal (real physical Transmission). Electrial signal,ratio waves, fiber and Cable/Wire         |

#### 9. TCP/IP Model

Real-world networking model.

| Layer          | Protocols |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Application    | HTTP, DNS |
| Transport      | TCP, UDP  |
| Internet       | IP        |
| Network Access | Ethernet  |
---
#### 10. Subnetting: Subnetting divides large networks into smaller networks.
Dividing one big network into smaller parts using IP range or Ip base network

##### CIDR (Class less inter domain routing) / Compact subnet notation.
- Example: 192.168.1.0/24
- /24 means: The number after "/ " Shows how many bits are used for the network port.
- First 24 bits for network remaining bits for Devices/ Hosts
- /32 = 1ip (2^0) for host/device like
- 31=2ip  remaing number is 1 so the value is (2^1) , 30=4ip same as (2^2) , 29=8ip (2^3), 28=16ip (2^4), 27=32ip (2^5), 26=64ip (2^6), 25=128ip
| CIDR | Hosts         |
| ---- | ------------- |
| /24  | 256  (2^7)    |
| /16  | 65536         |
| /8   | 1.6 cr Large network |
- Why Used: Better security, Better management and Reduce traffic
---
#### 11. Gateway: Gateway connects one network to another.

Example: Local network → Internet

### Command

```bash
ip route
route -n
```
---

#### 12. Router: Router forwards packets between networks.
Routing is use to finding/ choose the best or shortest path/ route to send data / data packets to travel from source to destination across networks.
- To avoid network congestion: Use routing table repeately until to find the best path.
- static routing is manually configured route.
- dynamic routing is automatically using protocals/rules.
- Example: Home Router connects: Laptop ↔ Internet

---
#### 13. Switch: Switch connects devices inside same network. Works using MAC addresses.
---
#### 14. Firewall: It's a security graud for company network
- A firewall is a security system that mointors and  controls incoming/outgoing network traffic.
- It soes not allow unauthorized person to access the data, data theft, malware attacks  this are blocked by firewall.

Types of firewall
- network firewall: protect entire network
- Host firewall: Install on individual system
- Cloud firewall: AWS security Groups: Acts like firewall, controles inbound and outbound traffic/ calls

Linux Firewall

```bash
ufw
iptables
firewalld
Example: Allow SSH: ufw allow 22
```
---
#### 15. NAT (Network Address Translation): Converts private IP vice-versa public IP.
- NAT allows private networks to access the internet using a public IP.
- In AWS private network cant access the public internet directly so that use NAT gateway
Type
1. Static NAT: 1 private --> 1 public.
2. Dynamic: uses pool of public IP.
3. PAT (Port Address Transiation): Many private IP's 1--> 1 public IP using ports 
- Example: Multiple systems use one public IP.
- Used in: Home routers, Cloud networking, Kubernetes
---
#### 16. DHCP: DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses.
- Without DHCP: Need manual IP configuration.
- Commands
```bash
dhclient
```
---
#### Cloud Network: Network inside the cloud like rent it. Play how much you use or how much you wnat.

#### 17. VPN (Virtual Private Network): Secure encrypted connection between user and company network.
- VPC is your private, secure and separete network inside the cloud
- Used in: Remote work, Secure access, Cloud connectivity
---
#### 18. Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple servers.

#### Types

| Type    | Usage      |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Layer 4 | TCP/UDP    |
| Layer 7 | HTTP/HTTPS |

#### Popular Load Balancers

* NGINX
* HAProxy
* AWS ELB
* Traefik
---
#### 19. Reverse Proxy: Client sends request to proxy → proxy forwards to backend.
- Used For: SSL termination, Security, Load balancing, Routing
- Examples: NGINX, Traefik
---
#### 20. SSL/TLS: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): Secure communication over network. TLS (Transport Layer Security): Modern secure communication protocol

Why
- Encrypt communication
- Protect sensitive data
- Secure websites
- Prevent hacking/sniffingEncrypts communication.

Used in:
- HTTPS websites
- APIs
- Banking apps
- Kubernetes ingress
- DevOps tools

Example: HTTP  → Not Secure or HTTPS → Secure

##### Certificate Files

```text
.crt
.key
.pem
```
---
#### 21. HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose    |
| ------ | ---------- |
| GET    | Fetch data |
| POST   | Send data  |
| PUT    | Update     |
| DELETE | Remove     |

---

#### 22. API: API allows applications to communicate. `Example: Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database`
- API Types: REST API, SOAP API, GraphQL
---
#### 23. Packet: Small piece of data transferred over network.
---
#### 24. Latency: Delay in communication. `Check latency: ping google.com`
---
#### 25. Bandwidth: Bandwidth = Amount of data transferable. `Example: 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps`
---
#### 26. Ping: Checks connectivity. `ping google.com`
---
#### 27. Traceroute: Shows path packets travel.

```bash
traceroute google.com
tracepath google.com
```
---
#### 30. Network Interface Card (NIC): Hardware/network adapter used for communication. `Command: ip link`

These are the most important concepts DevOps engineers use daily.
